Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

train_simple_spread_rllib.py

This script is responsible for setting up and running a reinforcement learning training experiment using the Ray RLlib library.

    Environment Setup:
        It defines and registers a PettingZoo environment called "simple_spread_v3" (from the mpe2 library). This environment likely simulates a multi-agent particle environment where agents need to spread out.
        It configures the environment to have 3 agents (N_AGENTS = 3) and uses discrete actions.
    RLlib PPO Configuration:
        It sets up a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm configuration, which is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm.
        Key training parameters are defined, including:
            gamma (discount factor): 0.99, indicating a focus on long-term rewards.
            lr (learning rate): 5e-4.
            num_epochs: 10.
            minibatch_size: 128.
            train_batch_size: 2048.
            model: A neural network with two hidden layers of 64 units each.
        It specifies a "shared_policy" where all agents in the multi-agent environment will use the same policy.
    Training Execution:
        Initializes Ray, a framework for distributed computing.
        Builds the PPO trainer with the defined configuration.
        Starts the training process using tune.run, a Ray Tune function for experiment management.
        The training runs for a specified number of TRAINING_ITERATIONS (50 in this case).
        Checkpoints are saved every 10 iterations (CHECKPOINT_FREQ = 10) and at the end of training.
        Training results and progress are automatically logged by Ray Tune, including a progress.csv file within the experiment's output directory.
    Automatic Data Saving Trigger:
        After the training completes, it automatically calls the save_training_data.py script as a subprocess.
        It passes the EXPERIMENT_NAME ("simple_spread_baseline") as a command-line argument to the saving script.
        This ensures that the training data is processed and saved immediately after the training run finishes.
